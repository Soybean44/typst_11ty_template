# Typst 11ty Template

This Template allows one to create a static site using typst and 11ty, powered by [typst.ts](https://github.com/Myriad-Dreamin/typst.ts). 

The template is really scuffed and put together haphazardly, but should be good enough for my usecases, If anyone actually knowledgable in web dev wants to improve on it, pull requests/forks are welcome and I will hopefully review/merge them in the future.
